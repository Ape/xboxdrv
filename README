[[ XBox360 USB Gamepad Driver for Userspace ]]
==============================================

This is a XBox360 gamepad driver for Linux that works in userspace. It
is a alternative to the xpad kernel driver.


[[ Compilation ]]
-----------------

Required libraries and tools:

 * libusb
 * boost
 * scons
 * uinput

You can compile by typing:

 % scons


[[ Running ]]
--------------

First make sure that the xpad kernel module does not get loaded,
either by deleting or renaming it. rmmod might not be enough since it
might be automatically loaded.

Once ensured that xpad is out of the way plug in your XBox360 gamepad
and start the userspace driver:

 % ./xbox360

This will create a /dev/input/js0 and allow you to access the gamepad
from any game. To exit the driver press Ctrl-c  twice
